# Soccer Tournament Manager

Welcome to the Soccer Tournament Manager project! This C# .NET application is a soccer tournament management system that simulates and manages soccer matches, player interactions, teams, and leaderboards. It was created as a code assignment for a job application to showcase my programming skills and understanding of object-oriented design.
